# MaizeField3D  
### A Curated 3D Point Cloud Dataset of Field-Grown Plants From a Maize Diversity Panel

## Overview

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in three-dimensional (3D) agricultural research—especially for maize—has been limited by the lack of large-scale, diverse 3D datasets. While 2D image datasets are abundant, they fail to capture essential structural traits such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial organization.

To address this gap, MaizeField3D provides a carefully curated collection of high-quality 3D point clouds of fully field-grown maize plants with diverse genetic backgrounds. The dataset is AI-ready and enables advanced research in maize phenotyping, plant architecture modeling, and structural analysis.

### Key Features

- Over 1,000 high-quality 3D point clouds captured via Terrestrial Laser Scanning  
- Diverse maize genotypes grown under real field conditions  
- Graph-based segmentation isolating leaves and stalks  
- Consistent color labeling by leaf order  
- Rigorous manual quality control for accurate segmentation  
- Rich metadata including leaf count, point cloud quality, and presence of tassels and cobs  
- Multiple resolutions via uniform downsampling: 100k, 50k, 10k points per plant
